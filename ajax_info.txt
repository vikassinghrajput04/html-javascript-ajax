Prison education is any educational activity that occurs inside prison. Courses can include basic literacy programs, secondary school equivalency programs, vocational education and tertiary education. The history of and current practices in prison education vary greatly among countries. Staff and budget shortages, a lack of educational resources and computers, and the transfer of prisoners between facilities are common barriers. Studies consistently show that education in prison is an effective way of reducing the rates of recidivism, which saves the expense of future prison sentences. In the US, every dollar spent on prison education saves taxpayers four to five dollars. Despite the benefits of prison education programs, rates of education within prisons remain low in many countries, and attempts to increase the rate of and funding for prison education have been opposed. Opponents argue that prison education is a waste of money and that prisoners are not deserving of the benefit.
